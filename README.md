# Comparison-based Sorting Algorithms

This project implements and compares the performance of various comparison-based sorting algorithms. The goal is to analyze their execution time for different input sizes and specific cases (sorted and reversely sorted inputs).

## Table of Contents
The implementation can be found in the [Project1.ipynb](https://github.com/Khondoker-M/Algorithm-Project-/blob/main/Project1.ipynb) file.

## Algorithms Implemented

The following sorting algorithms are implemented in this project:

1. **Insertion Sort**
2. **Merge Sort**
3. **Heapsort** (vector-based, inserting one item at a time)
4. **In-place Quicksort** (pivot: first, last, or random item)
5. **Modified Quicksort**
   - Uses median-of-three as the pivot.
   - For small sub-problems (size â‰¤ `k`), insertion sort is used.

## Execution Instructions

Follow these steps to run the sorting algorithms and analyze their performance:

- Run the Jupyter Notebook in Local or google colab
